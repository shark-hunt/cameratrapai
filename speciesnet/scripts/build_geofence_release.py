"""Script to build the geofence release from geofence base with extra manual fixes.

This module also includes tools for building taxonomy_release.txt from the labels
file (e.g. always_crop_99710272_22x8_v12_epoch_00148.labels.txt).

A geofencing .json file defines a "global geofencing dict".

Keys in a global geofencing dict are five-token SpeciesNet taxonomy strings,
for example:

aves;accipitriformes;accipitridae;accipiter;rhodogaster

Each item in a global geofencing dict is a "taxon geofencing dict", containing
"allow" and/or "block" rules for that taxon.  The only valid keys in a taxon
geofencing dict are "allow" and "block".  In the base geofence file, only "allow"
rules are valid.

"allow" or block" are mapped a to "regional rules dict".  Each key in a regional
rules dict is a three-letter country code, and the corresponding value is a list
of regional rules within that country.  Currently that list is empty for all country
codes other than "USA".

Examples:

This taxon would be allowed in RUS, SGP, THA, TWN, and VNM.  In the USA,
it would be allowed in AK but blocked in all other states.  It would be
blocked in all other countries.

    "aves;accipitriformes;accipitridae;accipiter;soloensis": {
        "allow": {
            "RUS": [],
            "SGP": [],
            "THA": [],
            "TWN": [],
            "USA": [
                "AK"
            ],
            "VNM": []
        }
    }

This taxon would be blocked in ABW and AFG, allowed everywhere else:

    "mammalia;cetartiodactyla;hippopotamidae;;": {
        "block": {
            "ABW": [],
            "AFG": []
        }

Additional conventions:

* If a taxon is not included in the geofence, it's allowed everywhere.
* If a taxon has only an empty allow-list, it's allowed everywhere.
* If allow rules exist for a taxon, any country not on the allow-list for that
  taxon is blocked.
* Block rules "win" over allow rules.  Taxa that are allowed in the base geofence
  may later get blocked
